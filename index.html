          Africans from rural areas are migrating to urban areas for better job
          opportunities. This led to a population spike in urbanized cities.
          Because of this, the demand for transportation increased as well. It’s
          estimated that the African automobile industry could sell up to 10
          million units in the next few years. But only a few companies are
          producing vehicles in the country. To meet the demand, there should
          also be an increase in the number of automobile companies. This makes
          the automobile business an ideal in Africa. Moreover, the need for
          auto services such as auto parts or repair services could also
          increase.

        <header>Solar Power</header>
        <p>
          Many areas in Africa enjoy at least 300 days of sun all year long.
          Thanks to that, solar energy is abundant in African nations. But even
          with that, several African families are still left without
          electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best thing about solar energy is that it’s free and it’s
          sustainable. . A lot of companies have tapped into this resource to
          provide electricity to millions of African homes. If you have a knack
          for sustainable energy, a solar power business might be a good
          business idea for you.

      <section class="main-section" id="Agribusiness">
        <header>Agribusiness</header>
        <p>
          Some parts of Africa are boasting with climates that are perfect for
          farming. In fact, Africa owns 60% of the world’s arable land. However,
          most farmers in the country do not have access to capital that allows
          them to cultivate their land. If they rely on the farmers alone, many
          African countries will experience food shortages. For this reason,
          agribusiness in Africa remains to be profitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, the concept of ‘crowd-farming’ is gaining much attention
          from the public. Crowd farming happens when people in one community
          pool funds to help farmers produce food. In turn, the investors get a
          supply of those crops during the harvest season. The African
          government currently spends at least $30 billion on food imports.
          However, if people continue to support local agribusinesses, the
          country can produce enough food for its people. This lessens the need
          for the government to spend much on imported food.

        <p>
          With more migrants are flocking into the urban sector, there is a
          pressing demand for affordable housing options. While the government
          is doing all they can to provide affordable housing, there’s still a
          need to build more houses to cater to all migrants.
        </p>
        <p>
          This need opens a door of great opportunities for business owners. You
          can start a real estate or housing company to supply this demand.

        <header>Waste Recycling</header>
        <p>
          Africa produces large amounts of waste every day. Most of these end up
          burned or washed away into the landfills and water bodies. This
          creates another problem for the African population. Hygiene and
          cleanliness are among the challenges Africa has been facing for years.
          If these challenges remain unaddressed, the problem will only get
          worse. Fortunately, entrepreneurs in South Africa and Ethiopia found a
          way to turn waste into a useful resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agriprotein is a South African invention that turns collected waste
          into animal feeds. In Ethiopia, they collect the waste from their
          cities and convert it into energy. This allowed companies to provide
          electricity to millions of homes across the country. Forty percent of
          the population growth in the world is expected to take place in Africa
          by the year 2050. With that, the waste is also set to increase. By
          starting waste recycling company now, you’ll have the chance of
          reducing the wastes before it piles up. Waste recycling provides an
          opportunity for businesses to help the African environment and people.
